Machine learning for the Prediction of Time-dependent Fluid Flows: Bi-LSTM Neural Networks for Sequential Temperature Forecasting. 

This project develops a computationally efficient method to predict how temperature changes over time in fluid flows, particularly focusing on flows driven by buoyancy effects, such as those in electric vehicle battery cooling systems or nuclear reactor passages (e.g., cold fluid flowing around heated rods). Traditional methods for simulating these complex thermal fluid dynamics are highly accurate but extremely resource-intensive, often requiring extensive computational resources. To address this challenge, the research utilizes advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) neural networks. These neural networks were trained using detailed simulation data from high-resolution numerical models, effectively understanding the complex patterns occurring in time-dependent fluid flows. The resulting model successfully predicts fluid temperatures at a faster rate, significantly reducing computational requirements. This approach promises to greatly speed up engineering design processes and enable real-time monitoring of critical systems, showcasing the innovative potential of machine learning in fluid dynamics applications.
